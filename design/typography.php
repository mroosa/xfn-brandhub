            <h3>Primary Type Styles</h3>
            <p><strong>Xfinity Brown</strong> is our primary and most expressive typeface and should be used for headlines and other elements deserving emphasis, like subheads and price points.</p>
            <p><strong>Xfinity Standard</strong> should be used for product and dotcom experiences, long-form body copy and functional legal copy to minimize length and legibility at small scales.</p>
            <div class="img">
              <img src="<?php print $dir; ?>images/design-typography-3-1.png" alt="Primary Headline: Large headlines are set in Xfinity Brown Bold, with 1.25x leading and -20 kerning. This is the default setting for headlines." />
