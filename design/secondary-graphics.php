  <h1>Secondary Graphics</h1>
  <p>We have a robust library of secondary graphics that help with storytelling about our brand. Secondary graphics should not replace the Xfinity logo in communications.</p>
  <p>These graphics are unique to Xfinity and have been created to represent our brand in the best way possible. Please do not create any new secondary graphics.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions about this library please reach you to the brand team.</p>
